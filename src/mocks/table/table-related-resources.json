        "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://geoglows.ecmwf.int/\">GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow System</a> represents a daily 51-member ensemble streamflow forecast for over 1 million reaches across the globe. Gridded surface runoff, provided by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), is downscaled and routed to the streams using the Routing Application for Parallel computation of Discharge (RAPID). This animation layer shows the first 6-days of a 15-day forecast at 3-hr intervals. Additionally, a 40-yr historical simulation was produced based on ECMWF's ERA5 dataset. From this historical simulation , return periods for each reach are calculated and used to color the stream segments when/where events exceed these thresholds.</p><h3>What can you do with this layer?</h3><p>This map service is designed for fast data visualization. Identify features by clicking on the map to reveal the pre-configured pop-ups. View the forecast data sequentially&nbsp;using the time slider, which is set to three hour intervals by default by Enabling Time Animation. This layer type is not recommended for use in analysis.</p><h3>Which datasets are available?</h3><p>Into the ESRI Living Atlas mapping service, the following datasets are available:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fcc7fd564c6441fba3b310d2281173b7\">Global Stream Flow Web Map</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5c2e6d2137bb4d2187db387979db2f31#\">GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow System (6 Day Forecast)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=259e39b329e3494e965d9286687c18c5\">India: GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow System (6 Day Forecast)</a></li></ul>",

Gridded surface runoff, provided by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), is downscaled and routed to the streams using the Routing Application for Parallel computation of Discharge (RAPID). This animation layer shows the first 6-days of a 15-day forecast at 3-hr intervals. Additionally, a 40-yr historical simulation was produced based on ECMWF's ERA5 dataset. From this historical simulation , return periods for each reach are calculated and used to color the stream segments when/where events exceed these thresholds.\nWhat can you do with this layer?\nThis map service is designed for fast data visualization. Identify features by clicking on the map to reveal the pre-configured pop-ups. View the forecast data sequentially using the time slider, which is set to three hour intervals by default by Enabling Time Animation. This layer type is not recommended for use in analysis.\nWhich datasets are available?\nInto the ESRI Living Atlas mapping service, the following datasets are available:\n\nGlobal Stream Flow Web Map\nGEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow System (6 Day Forecast)\nIndia: GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow System (6 Day Forecast)",

Existing land surface models (LSM) typically generate forecasts using coarse resolution grid cells which, at least for streamflow, have little value when used for flood warning at local scales. We present the design and development of a new automated computational system, using existing, well-established <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/open-source-software\">open source software</a> tools that quickly downscales (or maps) the runoff generated from such coarse grid-based LSMs onto high-resolution vector-based stream networks then routes the results using a vector-based river routing model. We conducted experiments using the ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data – a 35-year retrospective gridded runoff data product from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) – to assess our fast downscaling system. The accuracy of our approach is comparable to the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) – a well-established gridded routing model using the same forcings – but our method provides streamflow predictions on significantly higher resolution stream networks. We found that the river network resolution has negligible effect on the simulated streamflow with our model routing. In other words, we can forecast streamflow for very small stream segments and potentially improve local flood awareness and response much more successfully than previously possible using readily available climate forcings from LSMs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364815219304232#!\">A systems approach to routing global gridded runoff through local high-resolution stream networks for flood early warning systems - ScienceDirect</a></p>",

Existing land surface models (LSM) typically generate forecasts using coarse resolution grid cells which, at least for streamflow, have little value when used for flood warning at local scales. We present the design and development of a new automated computational system, using existing, well-established open source software tools that quickly downscales (or maps) the runoff generated from such coarse grid-based LSMs onto high-resolution vector-based stream networks then routes the results using a vector-based river routing model. We conducted experiments using the ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data – a 35-year retrospective gridded runoff data product from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) – to assess our fast downscaling system. The accuracy of our approach is comparable to the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) – a well-established gridded routing model using the same forcings – but our method provides streamflow predictions on significantly higher resolution stream networks. We found that the river network resolution has negligible effect on the simulated streamflow with our model routing. In other words, we can forecast streamflow for very small stream segments and potentially improve local flood awareness and response much more successfully than previously possible using readily available climate forcings from LSMs.\nA systems approach to routing global gridded runoff through local high-resolution stream networks for flood early warning systems - ScienceDirect",

        "description": "<p>Numerical models have become essential tools for simulating and forecasting hydro-meteorological variability, and to help better understand the Earth's water cycle across temporal and spatial scales. Hydrologic outputs from these numerical models are widely available and represent valuable alternatives for supporting water management in regions where observations are scarce, including in transboundary river basins where data sharing is limited. Yet, the wide range of existing Land Surface Model (LSM) outputs makes the choice of datasets challenging in the absence of detailed analysis of the hydrological variability and quantification of associated physical processes. Here we focus on two of the world's most populated transboundary river basins—the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) in South Asia and the Mekong in Southeast Asia—where downstream countries are particularly vulnerable to water related disasters in the absence of upstream hydro-meteorological information. In this study, several freely-available global LSM outputs are obtained from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis-interim/Land (ERA-interim/Land) and used to compute river discharge across these transboundary basins using a river network routing model. Simulations are then compared to historical discharge to assess runoff data quality and identify best-performing models with implications for the terrestrial water balance. This analysis examines the effects of meteorological inputs, land surface models, and their spatio-temporal resolution, as well as river network fineness and routing model parameters on hydrologic modeling performance. Our results indicate that the most recent runoff datasets yield the most accurate simulations in most cases, and suggest that meteorological inputs and the selection of the LSM may together be the most influential factors affecting discharge simulations. Conversely, the spatial and temporal resolution of the LSM and river model might have the least impact on the quality of simulated discharge, although the routing model parameters affect the timing of hydrographs.</p>",

            "description_stripped": "Numerical models have become essential tools for simulating and forecasting hydro-meteorological variability, and to help better understand the Earth's water cycle across temporal and spatial scales. Hydrologic outputs from these numerical models are widely available and represent valuable alternatives for supporting water management in regions where observations are scarce, including in transboundary river basins where data sharing is limited. Yet, the wide range of existing Land Surface Model (LSM) outputs makes the choice of datasets challenging in the absence of detailed analysis of the hydrological variability and quantification of associated physical processes. Here we focus on two of the world's most populated transboundary river basins—the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) in South Asia and the Mekong in Southeast Asia—where downstream countries are particularly vulnerable to water related disasters in the absence of upstream hydro-meteorological information. In this study, several freely-available global LSM outputs are obtained from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis-interim/Land (ERA-interim/Land) and used to compute river discharge across these transboundary basins using a river network routing model. Simulations are then compared to historical discharge to assess runoff data quality and identify best-performing models with implications for the terrestrial water balance. This analysis examines the effects of meteorological inputs, land surface models, and their spatio-temporal resolution, as well as river network fineness and routing model parameters on hydrologic modeling performance. Our results indicate that the most recent runoff datasets yield the most accurate simulations in most cases, and suggest that meteorological inputs and the selection of the LSM may together be the most influential factors affecting discharge simulations. Conversely, the spatial and temporal resolution of the LSM and river model might have the least impact on the quality of simulated discharge, although the routing model parameters affect the timing of hydrographs.",

        "description": "<p>Hydrologic modeling can be used to aid in decision-making at the local scale. Developed countries usually have their own hydrologic models; however, developing countries often have limited hydrologic modeling capabilities due to factors such as the maintenance, computational costs, and technical capacity needed to run models. A global streamflow prediction system (GSPS) would help decrease vulnerabilities in developing countries and fill gaps in areas where no local models exist by providing extensive results that can be filtered for specific locations. However, large-scale forecasting systems come with their own challenges. These New hydroinformatic challenges can prevent these models from reaching their full potential of becoming useful in the decision making process. This article discusses these challenges along with the background leading to the development of a large-scale streamflow prediction system. In addition, we present a large-scale streamflow prediction system developed using the GloFAS-RAPID model. The developed model covers Africa, North America, South America, and South Asia. The results from this model are made available using a Hydrologic Modeling as a Service approach (HMaaS) as an answer to some of the discussed challenges. In contrast to the traditional modeling approach, which makes results available only to those with the resources necessary to run hydrologic models, the HMaaS approach makes results available using web services that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. Web applications and services for providing improved data accessibility, and addressing the discussed hydroinformamtic challenges are also presented. The HydroViewer app, a custom application to display model results and facilitate data consumption and integration at the local level is presented. We also conducted validation tests to ensure that model results are acceptable. Some of the countries where the presented services and applications have been tested include Argentina, Bangladesh, Colombia, Peru, Nepal, and the Dominican Republic. Overall, a HMaaS approach to operationalize a GSPS and provide meaningful and easily accessible results at the local level is provided with the potential to allow decision makers to focus on solving some of the most pressing water-related issues we face as a society.</p>",

            "description_stripped": "Hydrologic modeling can be used to aid in decision-making at the local scale. Developed countries usually have their own hydrologic models; however, developing countries often have limited hydrologic modeling capabilities due to factors such as the maintenance, computational costs, and technical capacity needed to run models. A global streamflow prediction system (GSPS) would help decrease vulnerabilities in developing countries and fill gaps in areas where no local models exist by providing extensive results that can be filtered for specific locations. However, large-scale forecasting systems come with their own challenges. These New hydroinformatic challenges can prevent these models from reaching their full potential of becoming useful in the decision making process. This article discusses these challenges along with the background leading to the development of a large-scale streamflow prediction system. In addition, we present a large-scale streamflow prediction system developed using the GloFAS-RAPID model. The developed model covers Africa, North America, South America, and South Asia. The results from this model are made available using a Hydrologic Modeling as a Service approach (HMaaS) as an answer to some of the discussed challenges. In contrast to the traditional modeling approach, which makes results available only to those with the resources necessary to run hydrologic models, the HMaaS approach makes results available using web services that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. Web applications and services for providing improved data accessibility, and addressing the discussed hydroinformamtic challenges are also presented. The HydroViewer app, a custom application to display model results and facilitate data consumption and integration at the local level is presented. We also conducted validation tests to ensure that model results are acceptable. Some of the countries where the presented services and applications have been tested include Argentina, Bangladesh, Colombia, Peru, Nepal, and the Dominican Republic. Overall, a HMaaS approach to operationalize a GSPS and provide meaningful and easily accessible results at the local level is provided with the potential to allow decision makers to focus on solving some of the most pressing water-related issues we face as a society.",
