	     - GEO Work Programme Activities;
	     - Spatial search .

	- `AdvancedSearchBar`: Based on the `FilterBuilder`, the `AdvancedSearchBar` is a component in which the user can create simple or complex InvenioRDM queries. This component is intended to be used on the Front page of the GEO Knowledge Hub.

## Version 0.3.0 (2022-05-22)

- Package structure reorganized. With this change, the package is divided by component type, and for each type, there are the base components, their derivations, and thematic uses. For example, for table components, you have the following structure:
	- `base`: Directory with the base components;
	- `moldure`: Directory with derivations and junctions of the base components;
	- `thematic`: Directory with components ready for use on the different pages of GEO Knowledge Hub.

- All components have been rewritten and improved. The following components are now available:
	- Table for presenting Knowledge package-related resources. Its main features are:
		- Indexing and searching data in the browser via [minisearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minisearch);
		- Faceted search by resource type.
	- Table to store external related works with sort support;
	- Image carouse with lazy load and cache.
